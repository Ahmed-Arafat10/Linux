- Why linux ?
1- FOSS {free open source software}
2- secure
3- stability and performance

- Linux distribution (Distro) is an OS that is formed from a collection of softwares that is based upon the linux kernel.



- Linux file hierarchy

                        / ----root
        /bin     /proc      /boot    /etc   /home     /lib    /var
    All package             So device       users
    of system               can open       of system



    -Commands:

    - Print working directory
    $ pwd
    O/P -> /home/arafat

    - To clean terminal from all commands
    $ clear (OR) ctrl+L

    - List content of current Directory
    $ ls

    - List content of specific Directory
    $ ls /home

    - List all files/folders {Even hidden file}

    $ ls -a
        ->flag(option) -> enhance/improve command

    Note: any file starts with dot (.) means hidden file.
    $ ls -a /home

    - Change Directory
    $ cd /etc

    - Go back one Dir. from your current Dir.
    $ cd ..
    ->  /home/ahmed -> /home/


    ~ Full path vs relative path:

    Full -> cd /home/ahmed/music
        -> start with / {root}
        -> cd ~ {= /home/user}

    Relative -> cd music {I'm already in /home/ahmed}
             -> cd ../../Download

      {..} is a relative path

    - Create Dir. called cd in current Dir. and create Dir. called Test1
    but in previous Dir.
    $ mkdir cd ../Test1

    cd Downloads  -> means ./Download means from cur. Dir. go to Dowload

    - Open manual for specific command
    $ man <Command>
    ex: man ls
    OR
    $ whatis <Command>
    ex: whatis ls

    $ date

    - To show calender of current year
    $cal

    - Show all 12 months pf 1990 year
    $cal 1990

    - To create Dir/Folder
    $ mkdir <NameOfDir>

    - To create Dir. inside Dir. us [-p] flag
    $ mkdir -p <NameOfDir>

    - To create a file
    $ touch <FileName> <File2Name>

    VIP Note: extension in linus is useless (don't affect file itself), but we use it
    to make name of file Discriptive
    ex: file.txt , file.mp4 , file.png , file.gz
        text          video     photo         zipped

    - Avoid ><?*#  in file of a file
    - Everything in linux is file, Dir. is specific file

    - To show type of a file {whether text,video,image}
    $ file <FileName>


    - Copy a file from a Dir. to another Dir.
    $ cp <NameOfFile>
    ex: cp test1.txt       Document/folder1/

    - To copy multiple files at same time in cur. Dir.
    $   cp ./{file1,file2}      ./Document
    (OR)
    $   cp  file1  file2        ./Document

    - To copy one Dir. into another
    $   cp  -r  <folderFrom> <folderTo>
            -> Recursive

    - Will show a confirmation [N/Y], as it will override any other file with same name in Cur. Dir.

    $ cp [-i] file.txt ./folder1


    - To move a file to specific location
    $ mv <FileName> <Distination>
    ex: mv file11.txt       folder2


    - Will copy a file to my distination + renaming copied one to copy.txt

    - Rename copy.txt to file123.txt
    $ mv copy.txt  file123.txt

    - To remove a file
    $ rm <FileName>

    - To show a confirmation first
    $ rm -i <FileName>

    - To remove a Dir.
    $ rm -r <FileName>

    - Used to remove empty Dir. only
    $ rmdir <DirName>

    - Remove all files Dir. in Cur. Dir.
    $ rm * -r

    - Remove all files only
    $ rm *


    ~ Command for reading a file:

    - To show text in a file
    $ cat <FileName>

    -Show part of text, then you hit enter to show next part and so on , used when file text is large
    $ more <FileName>
    -> space: scroll down
    -> p: scroll up
    -> q: to quit

    - Show first 10 lines
    $ head <FileName>

    - Show first 5 lines
    $ head <FileName> -n 5

    - Show last 10 lines
    $ tail <FileName>

    - Show last 5 lines
    $ tail <FileName> -n 5

    - To write on a file inside terminal
    $ nano <FileName>
    ->ctrl(^) + x : exit
    ->ctrl(^) + o : write out(save as)



    ~ File Globeing:

    - Remove any file ends with [.txt]
    $ rm *.txt

    - Remove any file as aoo/boo/coo ...
    $ rm ?oo

    - Remove file1,file2,file3
    $ rm file{1..3}
    (OR)
    $ rm file[1-3]

    - read the contents of a text file one page(one screen) at a time. It has faster access because if file is large it doesnâ€™t access the complete file, but accesses it page by page
    $ less command
